Jaga, still 2 fonts only for selection, Material number stats with M and follows by Production number

rev = R-A  still shows

#5041 for X value

1) 2 fonts only available selection, 
2)  For GC  and IC part number is missing and replaced with production order number

3) For IC only 4 lines only there, suppose 5 lines need to mark

need to remove Rev , currently showing R in program output

5) thread description not working for characters, shows 9 for each character, also this should be before country of origin
